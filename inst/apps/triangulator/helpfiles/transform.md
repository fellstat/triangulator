# Estimate Type

This is the population quantity that is being estimated.

-----

Behind the scenes, this determines what transformation to apply to the estimates.
The sampling distribution for transformed estimates can be closer to normal than
raw estimates. Population size estimates are log transformed. Proportion estimates
are logit transformed. Other estimates are not transformed.
